### This code is a Node.js server-side code using Express.js and Mongoose.js to create a web application for a food ordering system.

The code creates three Mongoose models: `USER`, `FOOD`, and `ORDER`. USER model contains information about users, FOOD model contains information about food items, and ORDER model contains information about orders placed by customers. The code defines several routes, including the following:

* `/`: renders the homepage of the web application.<br>
* `/signup`: allows users to sign up by submitting a form with their name, email, password, and address. The code creates a new USER document in the MongoDB database using the USER model and saves the document.<br>
* `/login`: allows users to log in by submitting a form with their email and password. The code retrieves the corresponding USER document from the MongoDB database using the findOne() method of the USER model and checks whether the password is correct. If the password is correct, the code renders the user dashboard page.
* `/admin/:password`: allows an administrator to log in by entering a password as a URL parameter. If the password is correct, the code renders the admin dashboard page.
* `/add-dish`: allows an administrator to add a new food item by submitting a form with the name, description, price, and image ID of the food item. The code creates a new FOOD document in the MongoDB database using the FOOD model and saves the document.
* `/view-orders`: renders a page that displays all orders in the MongoDB database.
* `/purchase/:foodID/:customerID`: allows a customer to purchase a food item by clicking the "Buy Now" button on the user dashboard page. The code retrieves the corresponding USER and FOOD documents from the MongoDB database using the findOne() method of the USER and FOOD models, respectively, and renders a checkout page that displays information about the food item and the customer.
* `/update-user/:user_ID`: allows a user to update their name by submitting a form with their new name. The code retrieves the corresponding USER document from the MongoDB database using the findOne() method of the USER model and renders an update user page that displays the current name and a form to update the name.
* `/placeOrder/:userID/:dishID`: allows a user to place an order by clicking the "Place Order" button on the checkout page. The code creates a new ORDER document in the MongoDB database using the ORDER model and saves the document.
* `/view-user-orders/:userID`: renders a page that displays all orders placed by a user in the MongoDB database. The code retrieves the corresponding ORDER documents from the MongoDB database using the find() method of the ORDER model and renders an orders page that displays the orders.
